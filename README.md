# Artist-Identification
Automated Artist Identification Using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning Techniques

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a neural network model that can accurately identify artists based on their artwork. By leveraging deep learning and transfer learning techniques, we use a pre-trained ResNet50 model to classify artworks from a diverse dataset of artists. The project addresses challenges such as data imbalance, high dimensionality, and the subjectivity inherent in traditional art analysis.
